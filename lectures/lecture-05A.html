# Numerical features of a single continuous variables

&lt;img src="images/week5A/example-plot-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


* A measure of .monash-blue[**_central tendency_**], e.g. mean, median and mode
--

* A measure of .monash-blue[**_dispersion_**] (also called variability or spread), e.g. variance, standard deviation and interquartile range
--

* There are other measures, e.g. .monash-blue[**_skewness_**] and .monash-blue[**_kurtosis_**] that measures "tailedness", but these are not as common as the measures of first two
--

* The mean is also the _first moment_ and variance, skewness and kurtosis are _second, third, and fourth central moments_ 
--


**Significance tests** or **hypothesis tests**

* Testing for `\(H_0: \mu = \mu_0\)` vs. `\(H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0\)` (often `\(\mu_0 = 0\)`)
* The `\(t\)`-test is commonly used if the underlying data are believed to be normally distributed

???

* Australia uses full-preference instant-runoff voting in single member seats
* Following the full allocation of preferences, it is possible to derive a two-party-preferred figure, where the votes have been allocated between the two main candidates in the election. 
* In Australia, this is usually between the candidates from the Coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party.

--

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Majority of the country does not have first preference for the Greens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some constituents are slightly more supportive than the others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

* BEFORE plotting or making summaries think .monash-blue[**broad (open-ended) questions**] that promotes discussion and divergent thinking

What is the distribution of the first preference vote percentages for the Labor party across Australia? Is it evenly spread across electorates or are there clusters of popularity?

# Robust measure of dispersion

.flex[
.w-50[
* &lt;span style="color:#648FFF"&gt;**Standard deviation**&lt;/span&gt; or its square, **variance**, is a popular choice of measure of dispersion but is not robust to outliers
* Standard deviation for sample `\(x_1, ..., x_n\)` is 

`$$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$`

* &lt;span style="color:#785EF0"&gt;**Interquartile range**&lt;/span&gt; difference between 1st and 3rd quartile, more robust measure of spread
* &lt;span style="color:#FE6100"&gt;**Median absolute deviance**&lt;/span&gt; (MAD) is even more robust 

`$$\text{median}(|x_i - \text{median}(x_i)|)$$`

* Observations that are outside the range of lower to upper fence (1.5 times the box length) are referred at times as .monash-blue[outliers]
* Plotting boxplots for data from a skewed distribution will almost always show these "outliers" but these are not necessary outliers
* Some definitions of outliers assume a symmetrical population distribution (e.g. in boxplots or observations a certain standard deviations away from the mean) and these definitions are ill-suited for asymmetrical distributions

* There is a large frequency in the final bin.
* There is a decline in observations in the $40-49K range as well as dip in observations around $26K and $34K.
--

* The histogram is using a bin width of 1 unit and is **left-open** (or **right-closed**): (4.5, 5.5], (5.5, 6.5] ... (49.5, 50.5], so that 5.5 is in the smaller bin, where as right-open would place it in the larger bin.
* Occasionally, whether it is **left-** or **right-open** can make a difference. Or, you might also **set the breaks** controlling the min value where binning starts.

* There are various way to present features of the data using a plot and what works for one person, may not be as straightforward for another

* Upon further exploration, you can find the two movies that are well over 16 hours long are "&lt;i&gt;Cure for Insomnia&lt;/i&gt;", "&lt;i&gt;Four Stars&lt;/i&gt;", and "&lt;i&gt;Longest Most Meaningless Movie in the World&lt;/i&gt;"
