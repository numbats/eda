## üëã .monash-blue[Welcome to ETC5521 Exploratory data analysis!]

<br>

.monash-blue[Before modelling and predicting, data should first be explored to uncover the patterns and structures that exist. Exploratory data analysis involves both numerical and visual techniques designed to reveal interesting information that may be hidden in the data. However, an analyst must be cautious not to over-interpret apparent patterns, and to properly assess the results of a data exploration.]

# üéØ ETC5521 Learning Objectives

<br>
.info-box.wider-list.width70[
1. learn to use modern data exploration tools with real data to uncover interesting structure and
unusual observations 
2. understand how to map out appropriate analyses, and to define what we would expect to see in the data 
3. be able to compute null samples in order to test apparent patterns, and to interpret the
results of visual inference

# üíØ Assessment .font_small[Part 1/2]

# Active engagement is expected but not assessed

* Lecture and tutorial participation will contribute to this.
* If you have some clashes for lecture or tutorial, there are other opportunities to show your engagement, including:
  * posting in the Moodle/ED discussion forum, 
  * github commits (more on this later in the course), 
  * peer reviewing (more on this later in the course), and 
  * online submissions (see Tutorial Q3 for example). 
* There should be **at least 3 measurable and meaningful engagement activities each week**. Think about posting a question or a comment in the discussion forum each week!

---
# üíØ Assessment .font_small[Part 2/2]

# Weekly quizzes **10%** 
There will be a weekly quiz provided through Moodle. These are a great chance to check your knowledge, and help you prepare for the tutorial and to keep up to date with the weekly course material. Your best 10 scores will be used for your final quiz total. 
<br>

# Assignment 1, 2 (**25%** each): through GitHub classroom
Due dates are in Moodle and on https://eda.numbat.space/index.html. These are individual. 
<br>

# Assignment 3, parts 1 and 2 (**20%** each): through GitHub classroom
Due dates are in Moodle and on https://eda.numbat.space/index.html. We'll be working on a buddy system. For each part you will be randomly grouped with another student, and you will work together to provide a solution. Different partner each time. The work needs to be conducted using Github, so that your efforts on the team work will be assessed from your commits. 


---

# üî∂ Expectations .font_small[Part 1/2]

* Lectures are recorded but you are expected to have either attended the lecture, or watched the recordings fully, prior to the tutorial for the week.
* Tutorials attendance is expected. You should send an email ETC5521.Clayton-x@monash.edu if you expect to be absent in any week. 
* Questions related to the course should be raised at Moodle/ED discussion forum.
* For personal or private administrative issues, the email contact is: ETC5521.Clayton-x@monash.edu
* If you miss a lecture/tutorial, it is your responsibility to catch up with missed material, learn about due dates for material to be turned in, and getting assigned to a group for team work, as necessary.
* All times are given in AEST (Melbourne time).

---

# üî∂ Expectations .font_small[Part 2/2]

* **ETC5510 is prerequisite**. Some of you may have exemption (due to evidence of equivalent knowledge to ETC5510).
* It is expected that you have already basic skills at data wrangling, visualisation, simple modeling, and comfortable with reproducible reporting using Rmarkdown.
* The priority of the ETC5521 teaching team is to support you in ETC5521 material.
* It's essential in this course that you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. It is free to register.

# GitHub Classroom

We are going to use GitHub Classroom (etc5521 2023: Exploratory Data Analysis) to  distribute assignment templates and keep track of your assignment progress. 

1. Clone the test assignment by clicking on the link given in Moodle in the first tutorial.
2. Once you have accepted it .font_small[(note: some browsers do not work well with GitHub Classroom (so use Chrome or Firefox)], you can find your repo here:
<center>
<a href="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/140034520-etc5521-2023-exploratory-data-analysis">https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/140034520-etc5521-2023-exploratory-data-analysis</a>
</center>
3. If you don't recall how to connect this repo locally, check [this guide](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students).
4. In the first tutorial you will be expected to upload a file to your repo. We will check to make sure you have demonstrated abaility to use GitHub.
